vllm_medium,What is the Introduction of this document?,"The Introduction of the document states that LLM serving is costly and memory-bound, with the main bottleneck being the management of dynamic key-value (KV) caches. Current systems allocate contiguous memory, leading to internal and external fragmentation. The document proposes PagedAttention, a novel attention mechanism inspired by virtual memory paging, to manage KV cache more like OS paging, improving batching and reducing cost. This allows for near-zero memory waste and flexible KV cache sharing, leading to substantial throughput improvements over existing systems.

vllm_medium,What is the Background of this document?,"The Background of the document states that Transformers, KV cache role in autoregressive generation and batching challenges. B) must handle asynchronous arrivals and sequence length variance. Iteration-level scheduling helps reduce queueing and padding inefficiencies.
